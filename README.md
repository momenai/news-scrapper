# news-scrapper

I have made six Turkish news websites, Is a form of copying, in which specific data is gathered and copied from the pages, typically into a central local mongo database for later retrieval and plotting graphs for increasing links by time. Main steps are explained in image that it can be seen in appendix A in the pdf reports.

Most popular Turkish newspaper websites have been scraped and
extracted for the main news in that websites and ignored any things else. Eight objects have been created for each website, Milliyet, Hurriyet, Sabah, Odatv, BBC, CNN, sozcu and Al jazeera. 

Eight â€‹graphs have been plotted for each website to show increasing of links by time during 24 hours. X-axis is shown the time for compiling program and y-axis is shown the number of new links at that time.Graphs are plotting as following:
